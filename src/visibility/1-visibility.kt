package visibility

/*
*     If you donâ€™t use a visibility modifier, public is used by default, which means that your declarations will be visible everywhere.

    If you mark a declaration as private, it will only be visible inside the file that contains the declaration.

    If you mark it as internal, it will be visible everywhere in the same module.Internal is like Global in same module :)

    The protected modifier is not available for top-level declarations.
